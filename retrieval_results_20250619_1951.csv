Learn how to master these elements in this guide to technical SEO basics.Written byWebFX Marketing ExpertsLast UpdatedMarch 20, 2025What is technical SEO?Technical SEO is the process of optimizing the more technical aspects of your website for better rankings in the search engine results pages (SERPs). It can involve changes like increasing page speed, optimizing for better crawlability and indexing, and more.When it comes tosearch engine optimization (SEO), there are multiple types you should be aware of, one of which is technical SEO.On this page, we’re diving into technical SEO basics you should know, including what it is and the technical SEO elements you should watch out for.Let’s get started!Guide to technical SEO overviewWhat is technical SEO?Why is technical SEO important?10 important technical SEO to watchWhat is technical SEO?Technical SEO is the process of optimizing the more technical elements of your website for search engines to achieve higher rankings in the search results. It can involve optimizations like improving your page load speed, optimizing your site’s crawlability and indexing, submitting your sitemap to Google, implementing schema markup, and more.Why is technical SEO important?Technical SEO is essential because it can greatly impact your website’s performance in search engines.Search engines aim to give their users the best possible experience, which involves showing them websites that the search engine knows and trusts to meet their technical requirements, like being mobile-friendly, secure, and loads quickly.If your site doesn’t meet the technical requirements of search engines, the search engine may not even know your page exists, or it won’t believe that your website offers a good experience for users.If this happens, your site won’t rank in the search results, and users won’t be able to discover your website. That means less web traffic, leads, and sales for your business.That’s why it’s critical to follow technical SEO best practices and optimize for this type of SEO usingtechnical SEO toolsto meet search engine requirements.What are the most important technical SEO factors?The most important technical SEO factors include:Crawling, which is foundational to search engine optimization. If search engines can’t crawl your site, they can’t index it, and if they can’t index it, they can’t serve it in search results.Indexing, which is another critical piece to the SEO puzzle. Search engine crawlers need permission to index your website content — if your URL includes anoindexcommand, search engines won’t add it to their index or search library.Site architecture, which streamlines site navigation for search engines, plus provides context on the importance of different URLs. Site architecture also helps users understand your site — and how to find what they need.Internal linking, which helps search engines (and users) discover your site’s content and understand that content’s purpose. Good internal linking can take shape through navigational and body copy links.Best technical SEO tools for beginnersYou need a toolkit to power your technical SEO optimizations. With a technical SEO toolkit, you can analyze, troubleshoot, and measure — and often for free withtechnical SEO toolslike:ToolPriceUse casesSEO CheckerFreePerform an audit of your site’s current SEO performanceGet custom recommendations for improving rankings and trafficIdentify and fix issues that impact your website’s search rankingsGoogle Search ConsoleFreeSubmit URLs for crawling and indexingValidate crawlability and indexability for GoogleMonitor crawling, indexing, and schema issuesTrack Google Search performance, from impressions to clicksBing Webmaster ToolsFreeValidate crawlability and indexability for BingMonitor crawling, indexing, and performance issuesTrack performance in Bing search resultsScreaming FrogFreeAudit technical issues, like broken links and redirect chainsAnalyze robots.txt commandsGenerate XML sitemapsIntegrate AI for AI-powered SEO optimizationsDon’t fail your website’smost important testGet an SEO scorecard of your website for free in less than 30 seconds.Get Free Report10 important technical SEO best practicesSo, you now know what technical SEO is and why it’s important, but what about how to do it? What technical elements should you optimize on your site for better rankings?Here are 10 important technical SEO best practices to follow!Improve your page speedSubmit sitemapsOptimize your robots.txt fileOptimize your website architecture for SEOEnsure your website is secureMake sure your website is accessibleUse schema markupAdd internal linksFix broken pagesOptimize for mobile users1. Improve your page speedFirst things first, your website should be fast. Very fast. In fact, your pages should load in about two seconds.Why?Both search engines and users like fast websites.If a user visits your site and it takes too long to load, they’ll leave and choose a competitor. A slow-loading website gives users a bad experience when your images or content fail to load, leaving them without the info they need. In other words, a slow-loading website hurts your rankings and traffic.Plus,search engine spidersneed to crawl your website so that search engines can discover it and index it for use in future search results. Believe it or not, search engine spiders don’t have all day to crawl your site.If your pages load slowly, they may not be able to crawl the entirety of your site, leaving some of your pages invisible to search engines.2. Submit sitemapsYou should also ensure you have a sitemap for your website.Asitemapis basically a roadmap that lists all the pages of your website. It makes it easy for search engines to learn about every page on your site.Simply put, when you have a sitemap, search engines can easily index all your URLs, ensuring that all of your pages are candidates for higher rankings in the SERPs.There are two types of sitemaps — HTML and XML. You’ll only need to submit anXML sitemapto Google.And it’s easy to submit your sitemap to search engines like Google.Simply head over to Google Search Console and click onSitemapsfrom the menu on the left-hand side.Enter the URL of your sitemap and then clickSubmit.It’s important to regularly submit sitemaps as you add new pages to your site or update your pages so that search engines always have an up-to-date roadmap of your pages.3. Optimize your robots.txt fileWe mentioned before that search engines must be able to crawl and index your website. Otherwise, they won’t know your pages exist and, therefore, won’t rank them in the SERPs.This is where arobots.txt filecomes in.A Robots.txt file is a plain text file in your site’s root directory that is responsible for managing traffic from bots and preventing your website from being overrun with requests.It helps you tell search engine crawlers how you want them to crawl your website. For example, you can tell Google not to crawl pages like shopping carts or directories.While these files are handy, they are seriously tricky, and it’s easy to make a mistake. If you do, you could block search engines from crawling your entire website altogether, and that’s definitely not good.It’s important to optimize your robots.txt file because it can have a huge impact on your search engine rankings. If you’re new to robots.txt files, we recommend reaching out to a technical SEO expert, like SEO.com, to ensure your robots.txt file is in tip-top shape.4. Optimize your website architecture for SEOFourth on our list of important technical SEO elements is yourwebsite architecture.The architecture, or structure, of your website, needs to be optimized for both search engines and users.Your site structure determines how users will navigate your website. It should be easy for them to find the information they need and seamlessly navigate from one page on your site to the next.A logical site structure gives users a positive experience on your site, which is acrucial ranking factor.Plus, search engine spiders crawl your website by passing between links on your pages. That means your site architecture plays a large role in how search engines crawl and index your site.It’s important to ensure that your website includes:A logical site hierarchyMatching URL structuresBreadcrumbsInternal links5. Ensure your website is secureNo guide to technical SEO basics would be complete without mentioningwebsite security. Security is a major technical SEO element you won’t want to ignore.If your website isn’t safe for users, search engines may not index your site, no matter how helpful your content is, because it’s not safe for users and doesn’t promote a positive user experience.Plus, users won’t want to interact with or shop on a site that’s not secure, because their information could be compromised.One of the best ways to make your site secure is to implement HTTPs. HTTPs ensures that no one can intercept data that’s sent between a user’s browser and your website. For example, if someone buys something with their credit card on your site, their card details will be safe from potential hackers.To implement HTTPs, you’ll need anSSL certificate. To obtain an SSL certificate, you’ll need to choose a Certificate Authority (CA).Some popular CAs are:GeoTrustRapidSSLComodo SSLGlobalSign6. Make sure your website is accessibleWebsite accessibilityrefers to focusing on making your website accessible to everyone, including people with impairments or disabilities.When you make your website accessible, you ensure every user has a great experience on your website. If your website isn’t accessible, search engines may not index your site in the first place, even if you have high-quality, valuable content.There are a few ways you can make your website more accessible, including:Addalt textto audio and videoWrite transcripts for audio- and video-only content and link to those transcripts near that content to make it easy for users to findAdd captions to add videos with soundApply clear labels to formsUse headings and subheadings to divide your content and make it easy to digestEnable navigation control on your website with keyboards, like using the up and down arrows to scroll on your websiteWrite unique and descriptive titles for each page on your site7. Use schema markupSchema markup, or structured data, helps search engines better crawl and understand the content on your website. It’s coding that allows you to create enhanced descriptions that appear in the search results.Google provides asearch galleryof pages that would benefit the most from schema markup. You can add it to your:Product pagesContact pagesGuidesStep-by-step articlesPages that answer a direct questionPages that explain how to complete or accomplish somethingAnd moreFor example, let’s say you have a page that answers the question, “What does an HVAC technician do?” In this case, you can add FAQ markup to the page. ThisHVAC SEO strategycan help your answer appear in the search results and help search engines understand that your page answers this question.You can use a tool likeSchema Markup Generatorto easily add structured data to your page. Just select the type of schema markup you want to create, fill in the fields, and copy and paste the code to your page.8. Add internal linksAnother important technical SEO element to implement isinternal links.We mentioned before that search engine spiders crawl your website by passing through the links on your pages.If your pages don’t link to the other pages on your site, it will be difficult for search engines to crawl and index your pages.That’s why it’s important to have an effective internal linking strategy in place.You should ensure that all your pages contain links to other relevant pages on your site. For example, when writing a blog post, you can link to relevant pages when you mention a particular topic or a product or service you offer.You can also add a section on your pages that contains links to other related blog posts or articles on your site that readers may find interesting.9. Fix broken pagesBroken pagesgive users a bad experience because the content they’re searching for isn’t available.It’s important to ensure that you regularly find and fix any broken links on your website.There are lots of ways you can easily find broken links on your site. One of the easiest ways is to use a tool likeScreaming Frog.Simply enter the URL of your website and wait for Screaming Frog to crawl all your URLs. Once the crawl is finished, look through the report, navigate toResponse Codes,and then clickClient Error 4xx.This report will show you all the broken links currently on your site. Once you’ve identified these links, either redirect them, update them, or remove them completely.10. Optimize for mobile usersMobile users need to have a good experience on your website, too. Search engines want to show their mobile users websites that will look and function correctly so they can get the information they need.If your website isn’t mobile-friendly, you’ll miss out on tons of rankings and traffic.If you’re not sure if your site is mobile-friendly, useGoogle’s Mobile-Friendly Test toolto easily check:The best way to ensure your website is optimized for mobile users is to implement responsive design. Responsive design ensures that your site will display well on smaller screens and that all your functions, like buttons and shopping carts, will work on mobile devices.Learn more technical SEO basics on SEO.comWe hope you liked this guide to technical SEO!

Because even if your content is high quality and you have awinning SEO strategyin place, poor technical SEO can prevent it from ranking well in search engines.Proper technical SEO practices ensure that your site is fast, crawlable, secure, and mobile-friendly—factors that significantly influence your rankings on search engine results pages (SERPs).Without a solid technical foundation, other SEO efforts might not yield the desired results.What are the Core Components of Technical SEOWebsite ArchitectureThe architecture of your website plays a significant role in how search engines crawl and index your site. A well-structured site makes it easier for search engines to understand your content and ensures that all important pages are discovered and indexed.Key concepts in site architecture include having a logical URL structure, creating a clear hierarchy with main categories and subcategories, and implementing an internal linking strategy that guides both users and search engines through your site.Crawling and IndexingCrawling is the process by which search engines discover new and updated pages on the web. Indexing is how these pages are stored and organized in the search engine’s database, ready to be retrieved in response to a search query.Ensuring your site is crawlable means using tools like Google Search Console to submit sitemaps, monitor crawl errors, and identify any potential issues that might hinder search engines from properly indexing your content.Mobile OptimizationWith Google’s shift to mobile-first indexing, mobile optimization is no longer optional. Your website must be responsive, meaning it should work seamlessly across all devices, from desktops to smartphones. Mobile usability includes factors like touch-friendly buttons, readable fonts, and a layout that adapts to different screen sizes. A site that performs poorly on mobile devices is likely to see a drop in rankings.Site Speed and PerformanceSite speed is a critical ranking factor. Slow loading times can lead to high bounce rates and a poor user experience, negatively affecting your SEO.Tools like Google PageSpeed Insights can help you assess your site’s performance and identify areas for improvement, such as optimizing images, leveraging browser caching, and reducing server response times.HTTPS and Secure WebsitesSecurity is a key component of technical SEO, with HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) being the standard protocol for secure communication over the internet.Google has confirmed that HTTPS is a ranking signal, meaning that secure sites are more likely to rank higher in search results. Transitioning your site from HTTP to HTTPS involves obtaining an SSL certificate, updating internal links, and ensuring that all content on your site is served securely.Structured Data and Schema MarkupStructured data, implemented via schema markup, helps search engines understand the content on your site more effectively.By providing context to your content, structured data can enhance your search visibility with rich snippets—additional information that appears in search results, such as star ratings, event details, or product prices.Implementing structured data can improve your click-through rates and provide a competitive edge in the SERPs.What are some Common Technical SEO Issues? (And how to fix them!)Duplicate ContentDuplicate content can confuse search engines and dilute the ranking potential of your pages. This issue often arises from having multiple URLs with similar or identical content.How to Resolve Duplicate Content Issues?To resolve duplicate content issues, you can use canonical tags to specify the preferred version of a page or set up 301 redirects to consolidate URLs. Ensuring that each page has unique and valuable content is also critical to avoiding duplication.Broken Links and 404 ErrorsBroken links lead to 404 errors, which occur when a page no longer exists. These errors can disrupt the user experience and waste crawl budget—resources that search engines allocate to crawl your site.How to Fix Broken Links and 404 Errors?Regularly audit your site for broken links using tools like Screaming Frog or Google Search Console, and fix them by updating the link, redirecting it to a relevant page, or removing it altogether.XML SitemapsAn XML sitemap is a roadmap that helps search engines find and index all of your site’s important pages. It’s essential for large websites or those with complex structures.How to Fix XML Sitemap Issues?You can create an XML sitemap using tools like Yoast SEO or manually via sitemap generators. Once created, submit it to Google Search Console to ensure that search engines are aware of all your important content.Robots.txt FileThe robots.txt file is a simple text file located in the root directory of your website. It tells search engines which pages or sections of your site they should or should not crawl.What are the Best Practices for Robots.txt Files?Properly configuring your robots.txt file ensures that search engines focus on the pages that matter most and ignore those that are irrelevant or private. However, misuse of robots.txt can accidentally block important pages from being indexed, so it’s important to handle this file with care.Advanced Technical SEO PracticesCore Web VitalsCore Web Vitals are a set of performance metrics introduced by Google to measure user experience on the web. They include Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).Optimizing for these metrics involves improving your site’s loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability, all of which are crucial for ranking well in search results.International SEOFor websites targeting multiple countries or languages, international SEO is crucial. This involves setting up hreflang tags to tell search engines which language and region each page is targeting.You must also ensure that your site’s structure supports multiple languages and regions, using subdirectories, subdomains, or country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) as appropriate.JavaScript SEOJavaScript is widely used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites, but it can also pose challenges for SEO. Search engines need to be able to crawl, render, and index JavaScript content.Best practices include using server-side rendering (SSR), ensuring that important content is accessible in the HTML source, and testing your site’s JavaScript SEO performance with tools like Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test.Tools and Resources for Technical SEOSEO Auditing ToolsConducting regular SEO audits is essential to maintaining your site’s technical health. Popular tools like Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, and SEMrush provide comprehensive audits that can identify issues like crawl errors, broken links, and duplicate content. These tools also offer actionable insights to help you optimize your site’s performance.Performance Monitoring ToolsMonitoring your website’s performance over time is crucial to understanding how your technical SEO efforts are paying off. Tools like Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and GTmetrix provide valuable data on site speed, user behavior, and search performance.Regularly reviewing these metrics can help you spot trends and make informed decisions.The Challenge of Technical SEO is OngoingTechnical SEO isn’t a one-off task—it requires continuous monitoring and updates to adapt to changes in search engine algorithms and technology. As your website grows and evolves, so should your technical SEO strategy.Implementing the technical SEO practices we’ve outlined will help you build a strong foundation for your website’s search engine performance.

technical seo best practices,comparison_site_1__html,comparison_site_1,html,0.767,10,"What is technical SEO?Technical SEO is the process of optimizing the more technical aspects of your website for better rankings in the search engine results pages (SERPs). It can involve changes like increasing page speed, optimizing for better crawlability and indexing, and more.When it comes tosearch engine optimization (SEO), there are multiple types you should be aware of, one of which is technical SEO.On this page, we’re diving into technical SEO basics you should know, including what it is and the technical SEO elements you should watch out for.Let’s get started!Guide to technical SEO overviewWhat is technical SEO?Why is technical SEO important?10 important technical SEO to watchWhat is technical SEO?Technical SEO is the process of optimizing the more technical elements of your website for search engines to achieve higher rankings in the search results. It can involve optimizations like improving your page load speed, optimizing your site’s crawlability and indexing, submitting your sitemap to Google, implementing schema markup, and more.Why is technical SEO important?Technical SEO is essential because it can greatly impact your website’s performance in search engines.Search engines aim to give their users the best possible experience, which involves showing them websites that the search engine knows and trusts to meet their technical requirements, like being mobile-friendly, secure, and loads quickly.If your site doesn’t meet the technical requirements of search engines, the search engine may not even know your page exists, or it won’t believe that your website offers a good experience for users.If this happens, your site won’t rank in the search results, and users won’t be able to discover your website. That means less web traffic, leads, and sales for your business.That’s why it’s critical to follow technical SEO best practices and optimize for this type of SEO usingtechnical SEO toolsto meet search engine requirements.What are the most important technical SEO factors?The most important technical SEO factors include:Crawling, which is foundational to search engine optimization. If search engines can’t crawl your site, they can’t index it, and if they can’t index it, they can’t serve it in search results.Indexing, which is another critical piece to the SEO puzzle. Search engine crawlers need permission to index your website content — if your URL includes anoindexcommand, search engines won’t add it to their index or search library.Site architecture, which streamlines site navigation for search engines, plus provides context on the importance of different URLs. Site architecture also helps users understand your site — and how to find what they need.Internal linking, which helps search engines (and users) discover your site’s content and understand that content’s purpose. Good internal linking can take shape through navigational and body copy links.Best technical SEO tools for beginnersYou need a toolkit to power your technical SEO optimizations. With a technical SEO toolkit, you can analyze, troubleshoot, and measure — and often for free withtechnical SEO toolslike:ToolPriceUse casesSEO CheckerFreePerform an audit of your site’s current SEO performanceGet custom recommendations for improving rankings and trafficIdentify and fix issues that impact your website’s search rankingsGoogle Search ConsoleFreeSubmit URLs for crawling and indexingValidate crawlability and indexability for GoogleMonitor crawling, indexing, and schema issuesTrack Google Search performance, from impressions to clicksBing Webmaster ToolsFreeValidate crawlability and indexability for BingMonitor crawling, indexing, and performance issuesTrack performance in Bing search resultsScreaming FrogFreeAudit technical issues, like broken links and redirect chainsAnalyze robots.txt commandsGenerate XML sitemapsIntegrate AI for AI-powered SEO optimizationsDon’t fail your website’smost important testGet an SEO scorecard of your website for free in less than 30 seconds.Get Free Report10 important technical SEO best practicesSo, you now know what technical SEO is and why it’s important, but what about how to do it? What technical elements should you optimize on your site for better rankings?Here are 10 important technical SEO best practices to follow!Improve your page speedSubmit sitemapsOptimize your robots.txt fileOptimize your website architecture for SEOEnsure your website is secureMake sure your website is accessibleUse schema markupAdd internal linksFix broken pagesOptimize for mobile users1. Improve your page speedFirst things first, your website should be fast. Very fast. In fact, your pages should load in about two seconds.Why?Both search engines and users like fast websites.If a user visits your site and it takes too long to load, they’ll leave and choose a competitor. A slow-loading website gives users a bad experience when your images or content fail to load, leaving them without the info they need. In other words, a slow-loading website hurts your rankings and traffic.Plus,search engine spidersneed to crawl your website so that search engines can discover it and index it for use in future search results. Believe it or not, search engine spiders don’t have all day to crawl your site.If your pages load slowly, they may not be able to crawl the entirety of your site, leaving some of your pages invisible to search engines.2. Submit sitemapsYou should also ensure you have a sitemap for your website.Asitemapis basically a roadmap that lists all the pages of your website. It makes it easy for search engines to learn about every page on your site.Simply put, when you have a sitemap, search engines can easily index all your URLs, ensuring that all of your pages are candidates for higher rankings in the SERPs.There are two types of sitemaps — HTML and XML. You’ll only need to submit anXML sitemapto Google.And it’s easy to submit your sitemap to search engines like Google.Simply head over to Google Search Console and click onSitemapsfrom the menu on the left-hand side.Enter the URL of your sitemap and then clickSubmit.It’s important to regularly submit sitemaps as you add new pages to your site or update your pages so that search engines always have an up-to-date roadmap of your pages.3. Optimize your robots.txt fileWe mentioned before that search engines must be able to crawl and index your website. Otherwise, they won’t know your pages exist and, therefore, won’t rank them in the SERPs.This is where arobots.txt filecomes in.A Robots.txt file is a plain text file in your site’s root directory that is responsible for managing traffic from bots and preventing your website from being overrun with requests.It helps you tell search engine crawlers how you want them to crawl your website. For example, you can tell Google not to crawl pages like shopping carts or directories.While these files are handy, they are seriously tricky, and it’s easy to make a mistake. If you do, you could block search engines from crawling your entire website altogether, and that’s definitely not good.It’s important to optimize your robots.txt file because it can have a huge impact on your search engine rankings. If you’re new to robots.txt files, we recommend reaching out to a technical SEO expert, like SEO.com, to ensure your robots.txt file is in tip-top shape.4. Optimize your website architecture for SEOFourth on our list of important technical SEO elements is yourwebsite architecture.The architecture, or structure, of your website, needs to be optimized for both search engines and users.Your site structure determines how users will navigate your website. It should be easy for them to find the information they need and seamlessly navigate from one page on your site to the next.A logical site structure gives users a positive experience on your site, which is acrucial ranking factor.Plus, search engine spiders crawl your website by passing between links on your pages. That means your site architecture plays a large role in how search engines crawl and index your site.It’s important to ensure that your website includes:A logical site hierarchyMatching URL structuresBreadcrumbsInternal links5. Ensure your website is secureNo guide to technical SEO basics would be complete without mentioningwebsite security. Security is a major technical SEO element you won’t want to ignore.If your website isn’t safe for users, search engines may not index your site, no matter how helpful your content is, because it’s not safe for users and doesn’t promote a positive user experience.Plus, users won’t want to interact with or shop on a site that’s not secure, because their information could be compromised.One of the best ways to make your site secure is to implement HTTPs. HTTPs ensures that no one can intercept data that’s sent between a user’s browser and your website. For example, if someone buys something with their credit card on your site, their card details will be safe from potential hackers.To implement HTTPs, you’ll need anSSL certificate. To obtain an SSL certificate, you’ll need to choose a Certificate Authority (CA).Some popular CAs are:GeoTrustRapidSSLComodo SSLGlobalSign6. Make sure your website is accessibleWebsite accessibilityrefers to focusing on making your website accessible to everyone, including people with impairments or disabilities.When you make your website accessible, you ensure every user has a great experience on your website. If your website isn’t accessible, search engines may not index your site in the first place, even if you have high-quality, valuable content.There are a few ways you can make your website more accessible, including:Addalt textto audio and videoWrite transcripts for audio- and video-only content and link to those transcripts near that content to make it easy for users to findAdd captions to add videos with soundApply clear labels to formsUse headings and subheadings to divide your content and make it easy to digestEnable navigation control on your website with keyboards, like using the up and down arrows to scroll on your websiteWrite unique and descriptive titles for each page on your site7. Use schema markupSchema markup, or structured data, helps search engines better crawl and understand the content on your website. It’s coding that allows you to create enhanced descriptions that appear in the search results.Google provides asearch galleryof pages that would benefit the most from schema markup. You can add it to your:Product pagesContact pagesGuidesStep-by-step articlesPages that answer a direct questionPages that explain how to complete or accomplish somethingAnd moreFor example, let’s say you have a page that answers the question, “What does an HVAC technician do?” In this case, you can add FAQ markup to the page. ThisHVAC SEO strategycan help your answer appear in the search results and help search engines understand that your page answers this question.You can use a tool likeSchema Markup Generatorto easily add structured data to your page. Just select the type of schema markup you want to create, fill in the fields, and copy and paste the code to your page.8. Add internal linksAnother important technical SEO element to implement isinternal links.We mentioned before that search engine spiders crawl your website by passing through the links on your pages.If your pages don’t link to the other pages on your site, it will be difficult for search engines to crawl and index your pages.That’s why it’s important to have an effective internal linking strategy in place.You should ensure that all your pages contain links to other relevant pages on your site. For example, when writing a blog post, you can link to relevant pages when you mention a particular topic or a product or service you offer.You can also add a section on your pages that contains links to other related blog posts or articles on your site that readers may find interesting.9. Fix broken pagesBroken pagesgive users a bad experience because the content they’re searching for isn’t available.It’s important to ensure that you regularly find and fix any broken links on your website.There are lots of ways you can easily find broken links on your site. One of the easiest ways is to use a tool likeScreaming Frog.Simply enter the URL of your website and wait for Screaming Frog to crawl all your URLs. Once the crawl is finished, look through the report, navigate toResponse Codes,and then clickClient Error 4xx.This report will show you all the broken links currently on your site. Once you’ve identified these links, either redirect them, update them, or remove them completely.10. Optimize for mobile usersMobile users need to have a good experience on your website, too. Search engines want to show their mobile users websites that will look and function correctly so they can get the information they need.If your website isn’t mobile-friendly, you’ll miss out on tons of rankings and traffic.If you’re not sure if your site is mobile-friendly, useGoogle’s Mobile-Friendly Test toolto easily check:The best way to ensure your website is optimized for mobile users is to implement responsive design. Responsive design ensures that your site will display well on smaller screens and that all your functions, like buttons and shopping carts, will work on mobile devices.Learn more technical SEO basics on SEO.comWe hope you liked this guide to technical SEO!

Because even if your content is high quality and you have awinning SEO strategyin place, poor technical SEO can prevent it from ranking well in search engines.Proper technical SEO practices ensure that your site is fast, crawlable, secure, and mobile-friendly—factors that significantly influence your rankings on search engine results pages (SERPs).Without a solid technical foundation, other SEO efforts might not yield the desired results.What are the Core Components of Technical SEOWebsite ArchitectureThe architecture of your website plays a significant role in how search engines crawl and index your site. A well-structured site makes it easier for search engines to understand your content and ensures that all important pages are discovered and indexed.Key concepts in site architecture include having a logical URL structure, creating a clear hierarchy with main categories and subcategories, and implementing an internal linking strategy that guides both users and search engines through your site.Crawling and IndexingCrawling is the process by which search engines discover new and updated pages on the web. Indexing is how these pages are stored and organized in the search engine’s database, ready to be retrieved in response to a search query.Ensuring your site is crawlable means using tools like Google Search Console to submit sitemaps, monitor crawl errors, and identify any potential issues that might hinder search engines from properly indexing your content.Mobile OptimizationWith Google’s shift to mobile-first indexing, mobile optimization is no longer optional. Your website must be responsive, meaning it should work seamlessly across all devices, from desktops to smartphones. Mobile usability includes factors like touch-friendly buttons, readable fonts, and a layout that adapts to different screen sizes. A site that performs poorly on mobile devices is likely to see a drop in rankings.Site Speed and PerformanceSite speed is a critical ranking factor. Slow loading times can lead to high bounce rates and a poor user experience, negatively affecting your SEO.Tools like Google PageSpeed Insights can help you assess your site’s performance and identify areas for improvement, such as optimizing images, leveraging browser caching, and reducing server response times.HTTPS and Secure WebsitesSecurity is a key component of technical SEO, with HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) being the standard protocol for secure communication over the internet.Google has confirmed that HTTPS is a ranking signal, meaning that secure sites are more likely to rank higher in search results. Transitioning your site from HTTP to HTTPS involves obtaining an SSL certificate, updating internal links, and ensuring that all content on your site is served securely.Structured Data and Schema MarkupStructured data, implemented via schema markup, helps search engines understand the content on your site more effectively.By providing context to your content, structured data can enhance your search visibility with rich snippets—additional information that appears in search results, such as star ratings, event details, or product prices.Implementing structured data can improve your click-through rates and provide a competitive edge in the SERPs.What are some Common Technical SEO Issues? (And how to fix them!)Duplicate ContentDuplicate content can confuse search engines and dilute the ranking potential of your pages. This issue often arises from having multiple URLs with similar or identical content.How to Resolve Duplicate Content Issues?To resolve duplicate content issues, you can use canonical tags to specify the preferred version of a page or set up 301 redirects to consolidate URLs. Ensuring that each page has unique and valuable content is also critical to avoiding duplication.Broken Links and 404 ErrorsBroken links lead to 404 errors, which occur when a page no longer exists. These errors can disrupt the user experience and waste crawl budget—resources that search engines allocate to crawl your site.How to Fix Broken Links and 404 Errors?Regularly audit your site for broken links using tools like Screaming Frog or Google Search Console, and fix them by updating the link, redirecting it to a relevant page, or removing it altogether.XML SitemapsAn XML sitemap is a roadmap that helps search engines find and index all of your site’s important pages.

This involves setting up hreflang tags to tell search engines which language and region each page is targeting.You must also ensure that your site’s structure supports multiple languages and regions, using subdirectories, subdomains, or country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) as appropriate.JavaScript SEOJavaScript is widely used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites, but it can also pose challenges for SEO. Search engines need to be able to crawl, render, and index JavaScript content.Best practices include using server-side rendering (SSR), ensuring that important content is accessible in the HTML source, and testing your site’s JavaScript SEO performance with tools like Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test.Tools and Resources for Technical SEOSEO Auditing ToolsConducting regular SEO audits is essential to maintaining your site’s technical health.
